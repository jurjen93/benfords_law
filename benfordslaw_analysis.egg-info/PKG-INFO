Description: # Benford's law analysis
        
        Benford's law is a digit-law, which states that the distribution of seperate digits in numbers follow a specific frequency.
        This specific frequency is seen in many numerical datasets, as discovered by Simon Newcomb and Frank Benford.
        You can find on [wikipedia] more information about this mysterious law.
        
        Benford's law might be helpful to detect [fraud], do [science], or just investigate the [quality of data].
        
        #### Installation
        By ```pip install benfordslaw_analysis``` you will install the package.
        
        #### Usage
        Now you can do ```from benfordslaw_analysis import analysis``` to obtain the analysis script.
        Here there is the class ```BenfordsLaw``` which you can get with ```analysis.BenfordsLaw```.
        Now you can analyse your data by making plots.
        
        For example, make a plot with Benford's law versus random data with:
        ```
        from benfordslaw_analysis.analysis import BenfordsLaw
        from random import uniform
        random_data = [uniform(-10, 10) for i in range(0,1000)]
        bl = BenfordsLaw(random_data)
        bl.plot_first_digit()
        ```
        Note that we use the Euclidean distance between the digit frequency from Benford's law and your own data as a measure
        and that we use Poisson error bars.
        
        This package is still under development. More updates and documentation will come...
